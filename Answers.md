1) An adaptive website 'adapts' the web design itself to fit various screen resolutions but relies on predefined set screen sizes. The type of website is more user friendly compared to a fixed web design. However, a developer has to create different layout files for each and all screen sizes. This makes it challenging to account for all screen sizes. A resposive website adapts to fill all screens across all devices. This is the most user friendly approach. Also it is convient for the delevoper because he/she only has to create one layout file. However, this does make it slightly more difficult for a developer to code this type of file.
2) To be mobile first means to write a web design layout code to be compatible with a mobile view first. Then you use increasing breakpoints with updated code for the website to then become compatiable with larger screens from tablet to desktop for example. When creating new breakpoints the code neeeds to reflect a min-width value with increasing screen sizes as its property values. For example, min-width: 800 px then further down in css code min-width: 1000px. To be desktop first means to write code to be desktop compatiable first. Then use decreasing breakpoints for small screens in decending order such as tablet then mobile. Here one must use max-width property with decreasing screen size values. For example max-widht: 800px then later in css code max-width: 500px.
3) Using this percentage sets the font size ratio of the entire website so that 10px = 1 rem; 16px = 1.6 rem; etc. This makes the font size ration conversion easier between pixels and rem as it is a convenient 10:1. Using rem is the preferred font value over pixels when utilizing a responsive web design approach.
4) Preprocessing is the use of a preprocessor along with a compiler to make CSS eaiser to use and write. Preprocessors are extensions of CSS which increase the abilities of CSS while making CSS easier to write. Preprecessor uses a similar syntax to CSS but differs slightly depending on which Preprocessor you use. This difference in syntax does however make it easier for a user to write css code by allowing new additional such as nesting code, setting variables, and creating mixins. One can write a simpler and more organized code with preprocessors, then put the preprocessed code though a compiler which then outputs the required complete CSS code needed to run the HTML website.
My favorite concept in preprocessing is nesting as it allows the code to be more simplistic and organized which make it easier to write and read the code. It also allows the write to cut back on lines of code while easily seeing parent and child relations between elements. This in turn helps with viewing and controling specificity. My troublesome concept within preprocessing is namespaces. I understand the syntax of the property. But tt is hard to understand the concept of why it is needed and used. My problem with understanding this may be because I have not yet wrote or read complicated enough code yet.
